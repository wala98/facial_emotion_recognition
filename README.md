## 🌟 Motivation

Facial emotions are crucial in human communication. This project aims to build an intelligent system that can recognize emotions like happiness, anger, or sadness from facial expressions — enabling applications in:

- 📚 **Live class monitoring**
- 🧠 **Mental health assistance**
- 🧾 **Customer sentiment analysis**
- 🕹 **Human-computer interaction in games**
- 🛡 **Surveillance and security**

## 🧠 Emotions Detected

- 😠 Angry  
- 🤢 Disgust  
- 😨 Fear  
- 😀 Happy  
- 😢 Sad  
- 😲 Surprise  
- 😐 Neutral
